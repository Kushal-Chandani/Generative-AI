Pure automatic rewards can be insufficient or too simplistic. RLHF effectively **outsources** part of the reward design to humans, who can judge or rank outputs.

Over the last decade, it became prominent for large language models to ensure they generate **more human-aligned** responses. The popular usage in tools like **GPT** has shown how training a model with feedback (through advanced RL algorithms) can significantly improve user satisfaction."

        "1. **How do we handle conflicting human labels?**\n",
        "   - We can treat them as noisy labels and use techniques like majority voting, or we can model labelers individually using Bayesian methods. Essentially, we allow for some disagreement and try to find a consensus or distribution of preferences.\n",
        "2. **How do we make sure the model doesn’t exploit the reward model’s weaknesses?**\n",
        "   - Techniques like **reward model regularization**, **adversarial training**, or restricting how far the policy can move from its initial state (like KL-regularization in PPO) help mitigate reward hacking.\n",
        "3. **Could the model overfit to the training data of preferences?**\n",
        "   - Yes, overfitting is possible. We need validation sets of preferences and continuous user feedback. Cross-validation or further user studies can help measure real-world performance.\n",
        "4. **What if the human feedback is biased or unrepresentative?**\n",
        "   - This can cause the model to learn skewed behaviors. Collecting feedback from diverse, carefully screened groups can help mitigate bias.\n",
        "5. **Can RLHF be used in other domains beyond NLP (Natural Language Processing)?**\n",
        "   - Absolutely. RLHF can be used for robotics (humans rank certain movements or decisions) or recommendation systems (humans provide direct feedback on recommended items)."
