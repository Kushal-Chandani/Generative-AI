        "- Think of the Perceptron as a simple decision maker. It takes some numbers (like test scores), adds them up, and then decides if the result is above or below a certain mark (like a passing grade). If it's above, it says \"Yes\"; if it's below, it says \"No.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Perceptron is a small machine that takes inputs (like features about something), multiplies each input by a number (called a weight), adds them up, then adds a little extra number (called bias). Finally, it passes the result through a step function which outputs either 0 or 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This means the Perceptron is deciding whether something meets a condition or not, much like flipping a switch.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Perceptron is one of the earliest forms of a neural network unit. It takes an input vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. Each input $x_i$ is multiplied by a weight $w_i$, and a bias term $b$ is added. We then apply an activation function $\\phi$, typically a step function:\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  \\text{output} = \\phi\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\\right)\n",

        "- If the sum is greater than some threshold (often 0 when using a bias), the Perceptron outputs 1; otherwise, 0.\n",

        "1. **Non-linearly separable data**: The plain Perceptron can't perfectly classify data that's not linearly separable. It will keep trying to update weights forever (or until you stop). We need multiple perceptrons (multi-layer) or other methods (like kernels or advanced architectures) for non-linear boundaries.\n",
        "2. **Weight update**: If an example is misclassified, weights are nudged in a direction that makes the output more correct. The update rule is $w_i = w_i + \\eta (t - o) x_i$, and $b = b + \\eta (t - o)$.\n",
        "3. **Bias term**: The bias shifts the decision boundary away from the origin. Without bias, your decision boundary always has to pass through the origin (when all inputs are zero).\n",
        "4. **Decision boundary (2 inputs)**: For $x_1$ and $x_2$, the boundary is the line $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b = 0$.\n",
        "5. **How many epochs?**: There's no fixed rule. Often, we set a maximum number of epochs. If data is linearly separable, theoretically it will converge. Practically, we stop when misclassifications are zero or below some threshold.\n",
        "6. **Different activation function**: Yes! We can replace the step function with sigmoid, ReLU, or others. This transforms the Perceptron into different forms of neural network units (like logistic regression or modern neuron units).\n"
